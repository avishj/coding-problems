-- NOTE: The question has a mistake and states in the main question to give details for 
-- different payment_method's whereas in the example, it gives the details for different 
-- status instead. Neither of the given solutions give the correct answer, and there is 
-- no way to verify the correct output.

-- Edit: After reverse engineering the source code of the webpage, I have found the
-- expected solution at: https://sqlguroo.com/api/get-specific-data/12. My first query
-- was correct except for the possibility of the same product_id having multiple rows
-- within the same order_id, which now has been handled.
